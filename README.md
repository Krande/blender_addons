Experiments with blender addons

## Goals
* Get to know the blender api by creating a "bare minimum" addon
* Create a demo addon that checks for updates and allow the user to update the addon using a single click.

For local development of blender addons, I recommend installing the `fake-bpy-module` from https://github.com/nutti/fake-bpy-module using

```
pip install fake-bpy-module-2.91
```
